> #### INSTRUCTIONS

1. Peel the pumpkin and remove the seeds. Slice the flesh of the pumpkin into small bite sized pieces. 
Add them to a baking tray and bake for 25 minutes until cooked through.
2. Add the biscuits to the food processor and blend until they reach a breadcrumb like consistency (approx 1 minute). 
Add the coconut oil and vanilla extract (if using) and blend until incorporated (approx 30 seconds).
3. Transfer the blended base ingredients to a lined spring form pie dish. 
A spatula is easiest to ensure you get everything out of the food processor. Using a spoon spread it around evenly. 
Use the back of the spoon to compact it till it becomes firm and compact.
4. Wipe out the food processor. 
Add the roasted pumpkin to the food processor along with all the rest of the filling ingredients 
and blend until nice and smooth.
5. Using a silicon spatula transfer the filling onto of the base. Spread out so smooth and even.
6. Over a medium heat, heat a frying pan and add the roughly chopped nuts, stirring continuously for 2-3 minutes.
Add the maple syrup and keep moving the nuts around in the pan until the nuts are completely coated 
in the sizzling syrup and begin to crystallise. 
Remove from the heat. Once slightly cooler, scatter over the top of the pumpkin filling.

7. Pop in the fridge for an hour before slicing up. Enjoy!
